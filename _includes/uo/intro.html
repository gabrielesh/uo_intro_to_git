This workshop template and the lessons have been developed using <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> materials. 
  However, this is not a Software Carpentry workshop. The git lesson that we will teach here is a shortened version of the original
  <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/"> Version control with git </a> lesson from <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.
